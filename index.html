                Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia. Approximately 97% of Cambodia's population follows Theravada Buddhism, with Islam, Christianity., and tribal animism as well as Bahai faith making up the bulk of the small remainder.The wat (Buddhist monastery) and sangha (monkhood), together with essential Buddhist doctrines such as reincarnation and the accumulation of merit, are at the centre of religious life. According to The World Factbook in 2019, 97.1% of Cambodia's population was Buddhist, 2% Muslim, 0.3% Christian and 0.5% Other. According to the Pew Research Center in 2010, 96.9% of Cambodia's population was Buddhist, 2.0% Muslim, 0.4% Christian, and 0.7% folk religion and non religious. When the Khmer Empire came to power in the ninth century AD, Hinduism was the official religion. It had been the case in that part of the world for generations. Rulers of the great empire worshipped Hindu gods such as Vishnu and Shiva, and dedicated the 12th-century temple of Angkor Wat to these beliefs. It wasn’t until King Jayavarman VII, who ruled later in the 12th and 13th centuries, that Buddhism was fully introduced to the Khmer people. The temple of Bayon was the first in the Angkor complex to be built in the image of Buddha. Buddhism then infiltrated Khmer society through trade and interaction with nearby Southeast Asian kingdoms. Now, Buddhism is the most popular religion of Cambodia.
